TO LEARN:
--webpack configuration and about webpack.
-- babel configuration.




redux:
-one store : reduce storing same data in multiple store.
-reduce boilerplate.
- hot reloadin.
- immutable store.
- time travel debuging.
- small in size.


CUSTOM SETUP:
npm init.
-- create src folder
-- create index.html inside src folder, create div with id= "App".

create entry point for app.
-- create index.js in src folder.
-- link component to the root file in order to render, use rendrer of react-dom.
	
web pack:
-- bundle our compiled jacascript into a single minified file that works in a browser, 
-- webpack also include a development webserver to serve the application locally while development via webpack.
-- webpack is also used by CRA behind the scene.


configure webpack.
--web pack is configured via javascript object. and the file is called webpack.config.js and is placed in the project root.
-- it common to have a seperate donfiguration for development and production.

--create a file webpack.config.dev.js 
-- set the configuration on above file.


BABLE:
-- bable is a js compiler.
-- transpile modern js.
-- compile jsx to js.

BABLE CONFIGURATION:
-- bable can be configed via .babelrc or in package.json file.
-- bable preset will allow us to transpile jsx and modern js to run in todays browser.


AUTOMATE BUILD PROCESS:
-- to automate build process use npm script, it is simple automation tool build in npm.

DEBUGGER:
use debugger key to debug or stopo the code where you want to stop.


REACT COMPONENT CREATION APPROACHES:
-- container vs presentational components.

FOUR common ways to declare react components.
1. createClass
2. ES class
3. function
4. arrow function

createClass : original way when react was first launched.
class : uses extend react components.
function : react asumes that the function return is the componetn to render.
arrwo function : we can ommit the return keyword in arrow function.

NOTE: avoid var keyword in modern js.


when to use class coponent and fuctional componetn?
-- react version lower then 18.8 function component lacks some key features.
-- only class component has state, refs and lifecycle methods.
-- functional components is more powerfull with hooks.
-- componentDidError and getSnapShotbeforeUpade can only be done with class component.


CONTAINER VS PRESENTATION.


container:
--little or no markup.
--backend for the frontend.
-- typically use react redux connect.
-- pass data and action down to presentaiton component.
-- knows about redux.
-- often statefull.


PRESENTATION:
-- nearly all markup.
-- receive data and action via props form container component.
-- does not know about redux.
-- rely on props to display UI.
-- doesnt specify how the data is loaded or mutated.
-- not statefull

"when you notice that some components dont use props they receive but merely forward them down, its a good sign to introduce 
come container components."



HANDING 404 invalid routes.
-- create a page not found component.
-- use switch componetn to make sure only one router matches 
-- if no router matches then route to page not found component by simple adding that component in route at the bottom of the list.


REDUX:
	
	1

2	2	2

3	3	3	3

4	5	6	7	8

-- above tree is a react component tree where 1 is the parent of all other.
-- one has the user data and number 4 and 3 also need that user data.

There are three solution for this.
1. Lift state up. pass data down to each component trough props untill it react the required component also called props drilliing.
2. React context : you can expose global data with context from a given react component. To access this global data
   we have to import the context and consume it in required component.
3. redux : centralized store. any component can connect to the redux store.

REDUX HELPFULL IN:
- complex data flow.
-inter-component communication.
-noh hierarchical data.
-many action.
-same data used in many places.


when you know you need redux.
-  "if you arent sure you need it, you dont need it".

	 
suggested:
-begin with state
-lift state as needed
-try using context or redux when lifting state get annoyng.


REDUX cORE PRInCIPLES.
1. one immutable store. - aids debugging, server rendering make undo and redo possible
2. actions trigger changes.
3. State changes are handled by pure function : reducer update state.


redux data flow.

ACTION -> STORE <=> REDUCER
^            |
|            v
-------->  REACT

-- react app trigger action the reducer change state in store according to action and store reflect changes in react app.


history object in props: any component rendered by react router has history props.


ownProps: let us access component props and are automatically populated by redux.


selectrot functions.


HANDLING ASYNC and Errors:
-thunk dispatch action types that end in _SUCCESS. success suffex.
- an action can be handeled by many reducers.

IMPORTTANT: loader can be shown using the automatic dispatch of redux where the type end in _success while api call.
anywhere we receive the _success we can implement some logic.

- use local state when its scope is limited to that component.


- use react-toastify for toast message.


TESTING:
snapshot testing.
-part of jest.
-create a test file-> import renderer to render component.
-renderer represent tree which is output of the component.
- use renderer.create(<component />) to create a component.
- props can be passed in the component.
-jest.fn() creates empty functions.
- renderer creates snapshots and those shots are kept in a folder called snapshots which are created on the same folder of test file.
-- snapshot testing protect for any accidental changes to component output

ENZYME
-configure adapter.
- tell package.json to call the adapter.
-enzyme is like css we can use css selector here.
-with shallow render we can search for the component tag

shallow rendering:
- test one component in isolation.

rendering with mount:
-search final rendered html
- pull in react router memoryRouter for testing since the header component  expect react router props passed in.
- mount render the component along with its children.

NOTE: console.log(component.debug()) -- to output the element in console.

REACT TESTING LIBRARY:
-compelling alternative to enzyme.
-there are varieties of queries for testing result. ex getBy, getByText etc.
-unlike enzyme we dont have to call expect to make assertion.
- we can get the debug function by destructuring ex const {debug} = renderForm() and call this debug function to see the dom output.
